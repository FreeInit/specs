FreeInit.org <freeinit@freeinit.org>
v0.0, 2021-09-21

== Abstract
This is a template for an FI.O RFC.

== Status
Under consideration

== Rationale
A concrete example of a FreeInit.org RFC is of clear benefit.

== Main body
There is no "Main body" section in an actual RFC; put in your own sections in
this place instead, as many as you deem necessary.

== Bibliography
Here you may put references.
